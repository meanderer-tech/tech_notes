It turns out that AMD GPUs have no official support on Windows server flavours, this is done on purpose to avoid supporting the platform on AMD's part. 
We can manually hack it in, just don't expect AMD to help when there are problems. 

1. download the driver from official website, get the version the server is based on, for example
      Win2012 -> Windows 8
      Win2016 -> Windows 10
2. Run the self extracting archive, it extracts to C:\AMD by default
3. Find the inf files in the path C:\AMD\<package name>\Packages\Drivers\Display\WT6A_INF\*.inf
4. Find all instances of 10.0.1 and change it to 10.0 , the .1 at the end restricts the scope to workstation version of Windows, removing it puts server flavour support back.
5. Find CIMManifest.xml from C:\AMD\<package name>\Config and add the following tag called "table name="ATI_OS_Include" and put down the following directive to include server2016
  <table name="ATI_OS_Include">
  <col key="yes" def="i2">Index</col>
  <col def="s150">OS</col>
  <col def="s150">Version</col>
  <col def="S8">Is64bit</col>
  <col def="S8">IsMCE</col>
  <col def="S8">IsWindowsServer</col>
  <row>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>WIN_Server_2016</td>
  <td>10.0</td>
  <td>Yes</td>
  <td></td>
  <td>Yes</td>
  </row>
  </table>
  There may be other entries allowing other OS versions to install, but they are irrelevant. 
 6. move back to the root of the package and run setup.exe
